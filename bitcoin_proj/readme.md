## Description
    The process is divided into several process:-
    1) Getting the file from drive
    2) Confirming the token received
    3) Saving the response of token
    4) starting the prediction

    We are using keras for data modeling. R2_socre regression score function. The sklearn.metrics module implements functions assessing prediction error for specific purposes. The sklearn.preprocessing package provides several common utility functions and transformer classes to change raw feature vectors into a representation that is more suitable for the downstream estimators.
    
    The efficiency provided by this is around 60%.
